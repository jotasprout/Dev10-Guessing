/*

The application prompts the user for a maximum number.

The application validates the user input and does not allow invalid entries (negative numbers, 0, or non-numbers), re-prompting the user if an invalid entry is provided.

If the user provides a decimal number, the application rounds it.

The application selects a random number between 1 and N (where N is the user-provided maximum number).

If the guess is not a number, display a message: "That is not a number!"

If the guess is out of range (1 to N), display a message: "That number is not in range, try again."
